The Game:
You will fly a space ship to shoot out the rocks in the space as many as you can.but the ammunition is limited, and you can only replenish your supply by shooting the correct answer box.
You can choose the Practice mode which there is no Enemy Ship ,and the questions' number are limited between  0 to 10. It is a very friendly mode for kids.
